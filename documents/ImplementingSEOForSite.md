To maximize SEO on my site, I would do a few things:

Add informative titles that clearly communicate what each site's page is about and mention keywords that would show up on a Google search. I might use Google analytics tools to determine what keywords people are googling to get to similar sites, and emphasize incorporating those. 

I would love to add more information to make this site like real and usable.

I would update the layout to make the page really easy to follow and increase sizes of links to make them easier to see. I might change the color theme if I want to.
