SEO, or search engine optimization, is a way to optimize a website's visibility in a search engine results page. Lots of people
use Google to answer questions, look for products, and gain knowledge. For a business owner or someone who just wants their site to get attention, optimizing their site so typical related searches will pick it up is very important for increasing business and visibility.

Increasing SEO is to identify the keywords associated with what people are searching for when they want something that's aligned
with your website. You can use the Google Keyword tool to determine that. Then, you can implement those keywords in your site's
content. You can do this by incorporating a few keywords into your title tag, for instance.
